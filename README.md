Vector database development for RAG systems, enabling efficient semantic search and knowledge retrieval.

# RAG Vector DB

A project to design, build, and integrate a **vector database** for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.  
This repository focuses on **semantic search**, **document embedding**, and **scalable knowledge retrieval** to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) applications.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **RAG Vector DB Project** aims to create a robust and efficient vector database solution that:
- Stores and manages high-dimensional embeddings.
- Enables fast and accurate **semantic search**.
- Integrates seamlessly into RAG pipelines for **LLM-based Q&A, summarization, and knowledge retrieval**.
- Scales to handle large volumes of documents with minimal latency.

### 🔹 Key Features
- **Document Embedding Pipeline** – Converts raw text into vector representations using state-of-the-art embedding models.
- **Semantic Search Engine** – Retrieves contextually relevant results based on vector similarity.
- **RAG Integration** – Works with LLMs to provide accurate, context-aware responses.
- **Scalable Storage** – Supports millions of vectors with optimized indexing.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB / Weaviate / Milvus (configurable)
- **Embedding Models**: SentenceTransformers, OpenAI Embeddings
- **Orchestration**: LangChain integration for RAG
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes

## 🚀 Use Cases
- **Enterprise Knowledge Base Search**
- **AI-Powered Customer Support**
